Name your units according to this scheme to have custom loadouts. If not specified otherwise, add opf_ or ind_ in front of the unit name to have side specific loadouts for OPFOR and INDFOR units.
Append a _recon to the units to configure them as recon units (with silencers, ace_medical_medicClass == 1 and some other boni for example).
