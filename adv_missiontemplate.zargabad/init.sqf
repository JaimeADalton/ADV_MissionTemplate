//dynamic simulation is on by default. The values shown here are the defaults. Change to your liking:

//turn a vehicle into a radio relay that pushes the sending/receiving-distance for a specific side:
	//adv_handle_radioRelay_west = [VEHICLENAME, west, 50] call adv_fnc_radioRelay;

//turn a vehicle into a radio jammer that jams radio signals in the given radius:
